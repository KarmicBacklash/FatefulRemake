# FatefulRemake: A remake of Fate/Stay Night

This is an open source recreation of the popular visual "Fate/Stay Night".

A quick history lesson, Fate/Stay Night was originally released in Japan in 2004 as a japanese only Adult Novel, over the years it has had a number of fan translations, anime and manga adaptions, spin-offs, sequals and prequals. The long standing wisdom of the fandom is that to get the best experience with the series it is best to start reading the visual novel to its completetion. The biggest issue with this however is that is threefold:

* The Novel has never officially been released in english, or any other language besides japanese.
* The only offically supported platform is windows, and even then on modern systems it can be inconsistant and error prone.
* The interface can occasionally be slow or cumbersome to use

These three issues prompted the creation of this project. The design goals of this project are as follows:

* A 100% faithful recreation of the original novel using the script of the Reality Nua release as a base.
* Multi-platform support accross PC, Linux, Mac, Android, IOS and more.
* Crossplatform save compatibility.

Once these four points are completed and the entire project is polished there are other long term features I would like to be included, some of which are:

* Updated soundtrack and sound effects
* Updated graphics and art
* 16:9 support
* Translation support (Meaning the project can be translated to other languages with ease).
* A full recreation of Fate/hollow ataraxia (This would likewise have upgraded music, sound and art.)

Once these much larger tasks are completed, there are a small number of addition things that I would like to be included:

* An english dub of the dialogue similar to the japanese dub present in the Reality Nua release.
* An adaption of Fate/Zero in visual Novel form (This would be, without a doubt, the hardest to accomplish)
